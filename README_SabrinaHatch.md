# Reflection

This week was definitely more challenging for me! I feel like I was put through the wringer with this one, but having Anh to help me again was fantastic. Like I mentioned previously, while she's awesome at seeing the big picture of things and me with the more minute details, this week we definitely flipped the script. 

As before, we did start quite early on this assignment (and think god we did, as I am known to procrastinate down to the very last hour). Right away, we just spent time reviewing all the instructions and writing down what each step's "main idea" was. I think this made the task look much less daunting. 

So, on the first time we met, we mostly tackled creating our defendant java class and I did find myself getting quite confused on how to make the informed decison of public vs. static variables. I also had a tough time with making the constructors because it was hard for me to understand how they do their job. What did they return? When/do we ever pass arguments through them? Once we hit the constructor, there were many moving pieces, and to be quite honest, my head started to spin a bit. Thankfully, Anh and I did some research, but I'll be honest in saying that I am still a little lost on that front. Then, we worked on manipulating the rows of data and separating by attributes, which thankfully wasn't too bad since we went through all the stress of learning about that stuff last week. And then I called it quits so I could take a nap and decompress!

The second time we met, we focused on testing everything we had built so far. Anh was really good at being the "back seat driver" while I interpreted her ideas and translated them into real code. But, I will  say that I am still confused on how the test code works, specifically how our code connects to the TestCode.java file we already had. Nonetheless, the TAs helped us get through. 

Finally, on our last day working together, we just had to do the easy step of making the DefendantGroup class and all that other fun ProPublica stuff and we were finally able to send our data from csv file through our code. I have to admit, seeing that we got the correct analysis was such a good feeling. 

To make extra sure our additional methods worked (like adding or removing a defendant, etc) we made an extra testing method (which was basically like pulling teeth on a Monday night), and it passed again. Overall, this project wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be and I am again impressed by the power of collaboration in code. 

Without Anh, I likely would not have started this until the last second and I surely would not have the same understanding of the code and logic without her!

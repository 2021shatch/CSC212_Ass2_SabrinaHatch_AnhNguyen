# Reflection

In this assignment, I have the chance to learn more about class and method. We had to create a class for Defendant and a class for DefendantGroup. This assignment makes it clearer of why we want to approach a problem like this by using object oriented programming. We have many defendant and each has many information, it is good to have a way to easily access and modify each Defendant. If we don't have a defendant class, I would have try to store each defendant's information as an array. Although that could work,I can already see how much more troublesome it would be to access or modify the information. So I guess it's better to spend more time trying to create nice structure now so that it's easier to come back to this file or make modification in the future. 

Moreover, by have many classes and methods, it actually make it easier to build on top of what we already have. Because I know that the methods or class already works and I don't need to mess with what I have, it's much easier to create new object. 

I am still not fully understanding the interface in this assignment as in I don't understand why we want a ProPublica interface in this case since the methods are not something the user would need to use. 

This assignment makes me realise that Excel is really powerful. All the codes we are making now are already in Excel. When I load the csv file into Excel it automatically knows where to find each fields even though there are extra commas and no quotations marks in the original files. Now I really want to know how Excel and R deals with reading and storing data whenever we do analysis.
